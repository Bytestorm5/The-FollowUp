The following HTML document is a press release from an official government agency. Your task is to break down the claims made in the article into a clean and structured format, as described below.

The most important part of this is the classification of claims into three categories:
 - Statement
 - Goal
 - Promise

A statement is a claim about something factual irrespective of truth value. E.g. "The sky is orange", "The SEC does ..."
A goal is a broad, ill-defined, or "soft science" objective. E.g. "We will eliminate poverty", "We will honor the legacy of ..."
A promise is a specific, well-defined objective with a measurable timeframe / deadline. E.g. "By 2026 we will cut taxes by 20%", "In 90 days we will implement ...". 
In general, anything not defined enough to be a promise will be a goal.

It is acceptable and even reccomended to return no results if no claims were made. When setting a completion date, you have the option to give an exact date or a delta from a given date. You should use the exact date whenever possible.
